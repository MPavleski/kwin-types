# kwin-types
Type declarations for KWin's scripting API

This repository contains TypeScript type declarations for KWin scripts, based on [KWin's source code](https://github.com/KDE/kwin) and the docs [here](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/) and [here](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/api/)

I can not guarantee these to be fully correct. Any issues, help or suggestions are greatly appreciated and can be submitted at the [Issues](https://github.com/RubixDev/kwin-types/issues) tab.

An example on how to use these declarations is available [here](https://github.com/RubixDev/kwin-typescript-template)
